# 🍷 Cluster-Based Analysis of Wine Quality Using Machine Learning

**📌 Project Type:** Self-Initiated  
**🕒 Status:** Ongoing  
**🧠 Focus:** Clustering, Feature Extraction, and Model Evaluation

---

## 📍 Project Overview

This ongoing project explores the application of unsupervised learning techniques to analyze wine quality.  
The goal is to extract meaningful features from high-dimensional wine data, form distinct clusters, and evaluate their separation and interpretability using statistical and predictive techniques.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.
- Used **Factor Analysis** to identify latent features influencing wine quality.

### 📊 Clustering Techniques
- Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical) to group wine samples based on chemical properties.
- Determined optimal cluster numbers through **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Scores**.

### 🧮 Evaluation of Clustering Effectiveness
- Used **Fisher’s Discriminant Analysis** to assess separation between clusters.
- Evaluated cluster quality via **Logistic Regression** metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
